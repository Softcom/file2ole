Create OLE2 binary wrapper for any kind of file with C++ on Windows.

The project has its runtime linked statically, so no install of runtime environment (VC++) is needed.

The input and output files are both specified by command line arguments. They have to be absolute file paths to work correctly in any environment.

Tested on several Windows 7 machines (physical/virtual, domain/standalone, (non-)administrator user).
